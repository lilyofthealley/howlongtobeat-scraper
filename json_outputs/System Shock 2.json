  "description": "Choose your path, choose your weapons, choose your skills and then immerse yourself in what is arguably one of the most frightening, eerie and simply amazing titles around. It's a kind of action-intensive RPG that few can even come close to touching. System Shock 2 sets a new approachable precedent for all first-person perspective games. It's loaded with so many extras that exploration and interaction were necessities. Cybernetic monsters, rogue robots and a bunch of mutants called \"The Many\" dot an adventure that should not be missed by anyone with a backbone and a brain. Watch out for them psi- monkeys! ",
